Specifically, for hydrophone data, there are five low frequency hydrophones (Fs\\u2009=\\u2009200 Hz), and six broadband hydrophones (Fs\\u2009=\\u200964 kHz) dispersed around the north-east pacific. This acoustic dataset presents numerous potential areas of study in the field of ambient sound analysis. In this talk, we analysis 6 years of acoustic data to identify prominent features that are present in the OOI acoustic dataset. Some notable occurrences that are observed in the dataset include volcanic activity, rain and wind noise, fin whale vocalizations, and shipping events. For all low frequency hydrophones and four of the six broadband hydrophones, we will present long-term spectrograms, time-series trends for different spectral bands, different acoustic features that are present in the dataset, and different statistical metrics about the acoustic environment. We find that 6-year, acoustic, trends vary depending on the location of the hydrophone and the spectral band that is observed. Some locations and spectral bands see increases in spectral levels while others see decreases in spectral levels over the course of the 6 years.

We have previously shown that ambient noise interferometry can resolve multi-path arrivals between two bottom-mounted hydrophones separated by 3.2 km, at a depth of 1500 m, and located 470 km off the Oregon coast. In 2019, a seismic reflection survey was conducted directly over the two hydrophones for 28 days covering a 763 km2 area. The airgun shots occurred every 37.5 m while the ship moved at a speed of ∼4.5 knots, equivalent to a shooting interval of 16 s. The hydrophone recordings during this survey provide the unique opportunity to understand the effects of the surface source distribution on the noise cross correlation function (NCCF). In this talk, we show the sensitivity of the NCCF to the surface source locations using simulated and experimental data. Then, we use the image source method to analytically define the location of the sound sources that contribute to different delay times in the NCCF.

The technique utilizes strain rates in a fiber optic cable, observed via the backscatter of light pulses, to measure the acoustic field. Recently, the capabilities of this technology to measure higher frequency acoustic fields (10s to 100s of Hz) have been explored. Low frequency marine mammals calls at ∼20 Hz and ship noises have been successfully recorded, and a recent experiment demonstrated the capability to record up to ∼500 Hz. This talk provides an overview of DAS technology and introduces two recent experiments for studying water column acoustics with DAS. A 4-day experiment conducted in November 2020 as part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) provides data along two fiber optic cables extending west from the coast of Oregon by 65 km and 95 km, reaching depths of 590 m and 1575 m, respectively. DASCAL22, a recent experiment from October 2022, simultaneously recorded data using DAS at 2 kHz sampling rate on a cable extending 3.54km at ∼100 m depth and multiple moored hydrophones placed close to the DAS cable, allowing direct comparison between a new and existing technology.}, booktitle={The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America}, author={Douglass, Alexander S. and Ragland, John and Abadi, Shima}, year={2023}, month={Mar}, pages={A64–A64}, language={en} }\\n@inproceedings{Abadi_Douglass_Ragland_2023, address={Chicago, IL}, title={Comparing distributed acoustic sensing data with hydrophone recordings}, volume={153}, url={https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0018175}, DOI={10.1121/10.0018175}, abstractNote={Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a technology that transforms telecommunication fiber optic cables into dense sensor arrays by continuously transmitting pulses of light down the cable and measuring backscattering from natural inhomogeneities within the fiber cable. The technology can densely sample the acoustic field over long ranges (up to 100 km), providing a means for large scale passive acoustic monitoring. To evaluate the capabilities of DAS, it is necessary to benchmark and calibrate the technology relative to traditional hydrophone data. The DAS Calibration Experiment 2022 (DASCAL22) recorded 9 days of both DAS and hydrophone data in Puget Sound, WA in October 2022. The DAS data were recorded with a sample rate of 2 kHz, and the cable extended 3.5 km on the seafloor between two islands, reaching depths of 100 m, and the hydrophones were moored adjacent to the DAS cable at 5 m and 25 m from the seafloor. The recordings include impulses from an active source at 1 m, 5 m, and 10 m depths, and an abundance of passive acoustic data corresponding to ship traffic, wind, and rain.

This technique has been widely demonstrated as a powerful tool for seismic sensing, but the efficacy of submerged, under-sea cables for ocean acoustic sensing remains underexplored. The ocean observatories initiative (OOI) conducted a distributed acoustic sensing experiment in November of 2021, where two of the fiber optic cables continuously recorded the strain rate for four days. In this talk, the ambient sound field recorded by the OOI DAS experiment will be explored. A statistical comparison of hydrophone measurements and DAS measurements will be presented. Additionally, the possibility of using ocean ambient sound techniques, such as ambient noise interferometry will be explored and compared to hydrophone analysis.

Nine of the hydrophones are mounted on the seafloor and two of the hydrophones are suspended in the sound fixing and ranging channel. Six of the hydrophones record broadband ambient sound with a sampling rate of 64 kHz. Five of the hydrophones record low frequency ambient sound with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. In this talk, an overview of research and outreach conducted by the Ocean Data Lab at the University of Washington that utilizes this acoustic data will be presented. Some of the research topics that will be presented include trends in ambient sound and using ambient noise interferometry to estimate the Green’s function between two hydrophones. For the trends in ambient sound, data from 9 of the hydrophones over six years is visualized, analyzed, and compared to previous results. Data recorded by two low-frequency hydrophones has successfully been used to estimate the Green’s function between the two hydrophones by measuring the coherence of the ambient sound. Additionally, data of opportunity has been used to experimentally explore the emergence of the Green’s function for bottom mounted hydrophones in the north-east pacific. Lastly, an online, interactive data explorer for the low frequency hydrophones will be presented. This data explorer provides the opportunity for the public to view and explore the low frequency acoustic data measured and provided by the Ocean Observatories Initiative.

The technique uses coherent ambient sound to approximate the Green’s function between two sensors. It has previously been used in ocean acoustics to passively estimate water temperature, sound-speed structure, and mode shapes as well as for sensor localization. Since this technique utilizes the ambient noise field, whose characteristics are often unknown, understanding the effects of non-isotropic ambient sound is important for ambient noise interferometry. In this talk, an overview of the theoretical literature for noise interferometry will be presented with a specific emphasis on the effects of non-isotropic ocean noise source distributions. Additionally, simulations that explore the emergence of the Green’s function will be presented. Specifically, sound source distributions and environmental parameters such as sound speed profile will be explored. Lastly, the implications of these works on the possibilities and limitations of ambient noise interferometry will be discussed.
